# S-cool

Private learning-community platform built with Laravel, MySQL, Blade, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS and Vite.
The current environment is local development, not a production deployment.

## First-time setup

Start Docker and run in Bash (Git Bash on Windows; WSL requires Docker integration).
Git, Node.js/npm and curl are required; host PHP, Composer and MySQL are not.
Node 22 is verified. On WSL, use Node/npm installed inside WSL.

```bash
git clone --branch main https://github.com/Kerneural/S-cool.git scool
cd scool
bash scripts/verify-fresh-setup.sh --mode bootstrap
```

Setup checks the shared repository contract, creates `.env`/key, installs locked dependencies,
builds assets, migrates/seeds, starts five services and verifies the environment.
Wait for `[PASS] bootstrap on this host`. No extra installation command or Vite dev server is needed.

- [Application](http://127.0.0.1:8080/login): register a new account.
- [Mailpit](http://127.0.0.1:8025): inspect local test mail; it does not deliver to real inboxes.
- MySQL: `127.0.0.1:3306`; the application connects internally using hostname `mysql`.

Bootstrap requires a fresh checkout without `.env`, dependencies or an existing S-cool stack/volume.
Ports 8080, 3306, 8025 and 1025 must be free.
On failure, investigate the failed step; do not delete `.env` or volumes to bypass guards.

## Local demo accounts

Bootstrap seeds these accounts automatically. Open [Login](http://127.0.0.1:8080/login)
and use any email below with password `password`.

| Display name | Email |
|---|---|
| Local Developer | `devops-demo@scool.local` |
| Demo Creator | `creator@scool.local` |
| Demo Member | `member@scool.local` |
| Demo Platform Admin | `admin@scool.local` |
| Test User | `test@example.com` |

These are synthetic local-only credentials, never for staging or production.
Persona names do not grant Creator/Member/Admin permissions. Re-running the seed
preserves existing accounts and passwords; it does not reset them to `password`.
You can also register a new account.

## Daily operations

Run from the repository root. Always use project `scool` to keep the namespace independent of the folder name.

```bash
docker compose -p scool up -d --wait                    # Start the configured environment
docker compose -p scool ps                             # Service status
docker compose -p scool logs --tail=30 queue            # Worker process logs
docker compose -p scool exec -T app php artisan queue:failed
docker compose -p scool restart queue                  # After changing jobs/config
docker compose -p scool exec -T app php artisan db:seed # Add missing local demo users
docker compose -p scool down                           # Stop; preserve MySQL data
```

Frontend: use `npm run dev` for hot reload. Stop Vite and run `npm run build` to test built assets.
Application/job logs are in `storage/logs/laravel.log`, separate from worker process logs.

## Verification

```bash
docker compose -p scool exec -T app composer test       # Full test suite
docker compose -p scool exec -T app composer pint:test  # Code style
docker compose -p scool exec -T app composer verify     # Style + tests
bash scripts/verify-fresh-setup.sh --mode verify        # Build + runtime/queue + style/tests
bash scripts/test-setup-verification.sh                # Setup guard regressions
```

Verify requires the running stack with Vite stopped; it does not migrate/seed the development DB.
If `public/hot` remains, confirm Vite has stopped before removing that file.

## Safety

- Tests use `scool_test`, separate from development `scool`. The test DB is created on initial volume setup; older volumes missing it need separate investigation.
- Do not use `down -v`, `migrate:fresh`, `queue:clear` or `queue:flush` during normal operations.
- Demo seed preserves existing users. Persona names do not grant Creator/Member/Admin permissions. Never use sample credentials outside local development.
- Do not share `.env`, keys or sensitive data. Seed/reset/build does not make the local configuration production-ready.

## Working with AI

Open the repository root and start a new session with:
`start EUR-XX - Read AGENTS.md and report readiness before editing.`

Shared rules: [AI_WORKFLOW.md](docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md). They are IDE-neutral; personal agent settings are not required or distributed.
Agents must not commit/push/merge or mark Done without explicit authorization.

Project documentation: [docs/00_README.md](docs/00_README.md).
Setup evidence and remaining acceptance gaps: [docs/WORKING_CONTEXT.md](docs/WORKING_CONTEXT.md) and EUR-20 in Linear.
